# Integrating your orginization

Where should I put my orginizations policy files you ask?

You can and should organize your policies in any way that makes sense to you.
I very much encourage you to come to a consensus as an orginization, or at
least team. Seek input from others if its up to a single person alone, and be
sure to record your reasons for choosing the a specific pattern. There truly is
no right or wrong.

That having been said, I encourage you to organize your policy from a "service"
perspective. Service can also be a loaded word. To a sysadmin, a service may
mean an individual daemon like Apache, Nginx, or WebSphere. However services
are also combinations of other services like the ERP application, which may be
comprised of multiple tiers of database servers, webservers and loadbalancers.
When I say service I mean the highest level of abstraction you and your team
are comfortable with. I hope to show some examples that illustrate various
scales of "service", and explain the things I like about this structure.

Let's start with the highest level of orginization being either our company, or
our team. In the example I will use `skeletorg` because its a skeleton of an
example orginization and it brings to mind [the power of Greyskull][He-Man].

We will create the `skeletorg` directory inside of the services directory at
the top level of masterfiles and put all of our custom policy and files inside
of it. If you don't know what masterfiles is please read the documentation
[here][policy-framework], [here][authoring-workflow],
[here][bundles-best-practice] and [here][policy-style]. From here on I will be
refering to files *relative to the root of your masterfiles directory*.

Create `services/skeletorg/main.cf` with the following content:

```
bundle agent skeletorg_main
{

  reports:
    (inform_mode|verbose_mode)::
      "$(this.bundle): Activated";
}
```

`skeletorg_main_file_control` is where we will define additional inputs for our
policy, as well as any common bundles that you would like to explicitly add to
the bundlesequence. No additional inputs are defined yet, but there is just
enough policy to validate and run. Lets check the syntax, and then run the
policy.


Lets go ahead and make a few additons to `promises.cf` (the default policy
entry). In order for your orginizations policy to be evaluated your policy files must
be added to `inputs` in `body common control`, and then your policy must be
activated by either the bundle sequence or a [methods type promise][methods]

Here is a diff that shows additions I have made to the [default `promises.cf`
that ships with CFEngine 3.6.1][3.6.1-promises.cf].

First I added the path to skeletorgs main poilcy. Any additional policy files
we create will be added from here.

Second I activated the main policy using a [methods type promise][methods].


Now lets validate that our policy is syntatically correct
```
cf-promises --full-check --file ./promises.cf

```

The last line tells us our skeletorg_main entry bundle was activated. Now we
can move on to adding something useful.

# Who's who and what's what

Classification is key, It is not uncommon to spend a significant amount of time
determining how you want to classify systems, and it is very likely that you
will revisit it from time to time improving and adding new classification
options. Geographic classification can be quite useful, and in my experience
commonly map to subnets. We will classify location based on subnets stored
in an external JSON data file. Over time its likely that you will add
additional classification systems, for example you may want to classify systems
based on parsing the hostname. We will structure this classification policy
with that in mind.

Create `services/skeletorg/classification` to store all of our classification
policies. Another way to think of classification is dynamic host grouping. All
of our custom classification policies will be included and driven from
`services/skeletorg/classification/main.cf`. Create it with the following
content.

```cf3
bundle common classification_main_file_control
{
  vars:
    "inputs"
      slist => {
                 "$(this.promise_dirname)/subnet_location/main.cf",
               };

    "bundles"
      slist => {
                 "classify_subnet_location",
               };
}
body file control
{
  inputs => { @(classification_main_file_control.inputs) };
}
```

What does this policy do?

Bundle common classification_main_file_control defines two varaibles that we
will use to integrate our policy into the Masterfiles Policy Framework (MPF).
`inputs` defines a list of files that should be included in body common control
inputs. Note how the files are referenced using
[$(this.promise_dirname)][this_promise_dirname]. I think this helps to keep the policy
modular and makes things easier if you ever decide to re-organize and shuffle
your directories around. We could use this varibale directly in the list of
inputs defined in body common control, but I (currently) find its more elegant
to extend inputs in body common control using the new (as of 3.6.0)
[inputs attribute in body file control][body-file-control-inputs] as shown
above. `bundles` contains a list of common bundles that we want to
specifically activate early in the bundlesequence in body common control. There
is no way to automagically prepend or append to the bundlesequnce, nor do I
(currently) think there should be. You don't have to add common bundles to the
bundlesequence, but for common bundles that do classification and inventory
it's generally considered a [best practice][best_practice_is_bad_blog].

Let's go ahead and lay down the subnet location classification policy. Create
`services/skeletorg/classification/subnet_location/main.cf` with the following
content:

```cf3
bundle common classify_subnet_location
{
  vars:
      "subnet_data"
        data => readjson( "$(this.promise_dirname)/data/subnet_location.json", 10M );

      "subnets" slist => getindices("subnet_data");

      "subnet_nickname"
        string => "subnet_$(subnet_data[$(subnets)][subnet_nickname])",
        ifvarclass => canonify("$(subnet_data[$(subnets)][subnet_nickname])"),
        meta => { "inventory", "attribute_name=subnet nickname" };

      "city"
        string => "$(subnet_data[$(subnets)][city])",
        ifvarclass => canonify("$(subnet_data[$(subnets)][city])"),
        meta => { "inventory", "attribute_name=city" };

      "state"
        string => "$(subnet_data[$(subnets)][state])",
        ifvarclass => canonify("$(subnet_data[$(subnets)][state])"),
        meta => { "inventory", "attribute_name=state" };

      "country"
        string => "$(subnet_data[$(subnets)][country])",
        ifvarclass => canonify("$(subnet_data[$(subnets)][country])"),
        meta => { "inventory", "attribute_name=country" };

      "continent"
        string => "$(subnet_data[$(subnets)][continent])",
        ifvarclass => canonify("$(subnet_data[$(subnets)][continent])"),
        meta => { "inventory", "attribute_name=continent" };

      "site"
        string => "$(subnet_data[$(subnets)][site])",
        ifvarclass => canonify("$(subnet_data[$(subnets)][site])"),
        meta => { "inventory", "attribute_name=site" };

  classes:

      "subnet_$(subnet_data[$(subnets)][subnet_nickname])"
        expression => iprange( $(subnets) ),
        meta => { "derived-from=$(subnets)"},
        comment => "We commonly refer to subnets by nickname. It could be
                    43net, or something more fuzzy like frontend_webservers,
                    this just provides a standard way to reference subnets with
                    our normal terminoligy. Whatever the nickname, we prefix
                    with 'subnet_' to clearly identify it as a subnet. We also
                    set a meta tag to associate it back to the numeric subnet.";

      "$(subnet_data[$(subnets)][city])"
        expression => iprange( $(subnets) ),
        meta => { "derived-from=$(subnets)" };

      "$(subnet_data[$(subnets)][state])"
        expression => iprange( $(subnets) ),
        meta => { "derived-from=$(subnets)" };

      "$(subnet_data[$(subnets)][country])"
        expression => iprange( $(subnets) ),
        meta => { "derived-from=$(subnets)" };

      "$(subnet_data[$(subnets)][continent])"
        expression => iprange( $(subnets) ),
        meta => { "derived-from=$(subnets)" };

      "$(subnet_data[$(subnets)][site])"
        expression => iprange( $(subnets) ),
        meta => { "derived-from=$(subnets)" };

  reports:

      DEBUG::
        "$(this.bundle): Activated";
        "$(this.bundle): Found subnet $(subnets)";
        "$(this.bundle): Found subnet nickname: $(subnet_nickname)";
        "$(this.bundle): Found subnet city: $(city)";
        "$(this.bundle): Found subnet state: $(state)";
        "$(this.bundle): Found subnet continent: $(continent)";
        "$(this.bundle): Found subnet country: $(country)";
        "$(this.bundle): Found subnet site: $(site)";
}
```

What does this policy do?

This policy sets variables and classes for location data as it relates to
subnets using data sourced from an external json file. First, the json data is
read into the `subnet_data` variable. We then get a list of subnets from the
`subnet_data` variable. Once we have the list of subnets we can iterate over
each subnet and set variables if we are in on one of those subnets. Remember
that each host will determine this for itself as it evaluates the policy.
Before we get to far lets put some JSON data in place so we can better
understand how those specific variables are being extracted.

Create
`services/skeletorg/classification/subnet_location/data/subnet_location.json`
with the following content:

```json
{
  "192.168.33.2/32": {
    "subnet_nickname": "33_2",
    "city": "Lawrence",
    "state": "Kansas",
    "country": "USA",
    "site": "over_rainbow",
    "continent": "North America"
  },
  "192.168.33.3/32": {
    "subnet_nickname": "host001",
    "city": "Paris"
    "state": "Texas",
    "country": "USA",
    "site": "lonestar",
    "continent": "North America"
  },
  "192.168.33.4/32": {
    "subnet_nickname": "host002",
    "city": "Oslo",
    "state": "Ostlandet",
    "country": "Norway",
    "site": "tiger_city",
    "continent": "Europe"
  }
}
```

Looking at the JSON data we can see that we have 3 (very small) subnets.
`192.168.33.2/32`, `192.168.33.2/32`, and `192.168.33.2/32` each have
 a subnet nickname, city, state, country, site and continent associated with
them. When this data is loaded into a CFEngine variable we can access it like a
traditional CFEngine array. For example `$(subnet_data[192.168.33.2/32][site])`
would expand to `over_rainbow`.

Going back to our `classify_subnet_location` bundle we can see this in use:


```cf3
      "city"
        string => "subnet_$(subnet_data[$(subnets)][subnet_nickname])",
        ifvarclass => canonify("$(subnet_data[$(subnets)][subnet_nickname])"),
        meta => { "inventory", "attribute_name=subnet nickname" };
```

Instead of pulling data from a specifc subnet we are using CFEngines
[implicit list iteration][implicit_list_iteration] to loop over each subnet and
extract the subnet_nickname associated with it. We use
[ifvarclass][ifvarclass_documentation] to restrict the promise to only activate
when a class for that subnet_nickname is defined. We do not yet have any
classes for any of the cities defined, so this promise will be skipped on the
first pass along with the rest of the variables that are restricted to classes
that are as of yet undefined. CFEngine has a concept called
[Normal Ordering][normal_ordering] which refers to the order in which promise
types are evaluated. The next promise type to be evaluated that we have
promises for are classes, so lets take a look.


```cf3
  classes:

      "subnet_$(subnet_data[$(subnets)][subnet_nickname])"
        expression => iprange( $(subnets) ),
        meta => { "derived-from=$(subnets)"},
        comment => "We commonly refer to subnets by nickname. It could be
                    43net, or something more fuzzy like frontend_webservers,
                    this just provides a standard way to reference subnets with
                    our normal terminoligy. Whatever the nickname, we prefix
                    with 'subnet_' to clearly identify it as a subnet. We also
                    set a meta tag to associate it back to the numeric subnet.";

```

Whoa, thats a big one. Well, not really. But this one contained some "magic"
that I felt deserved some extra explination. I strongly encourage you to take
advantage of the knowledge management aspects in CFEngine, they are quite
useful over the long term. So what does this do?

This will iterate over the `subnets` list and define a class for the expanded
value of `subnet_$(subnet_data[$(subnets)][subnet_nickname])`. We only define
that class if the expression `iprange( $(subnets) )` evaluates to true.
[iprange()][iprange_documentation] will only evaluate to true if the evaluating
host has an ip within the range of the currently iterated subnet. So using our
example data, if the evaluating host has an ip address of `192.168.33.2` the
class `subnet_33_2` will be defined. Again we add some additional knowledge to
the class by setting a meta tag to identify the class as being derived from a
specific subnet. The rest of the classes type promises are pretty much the same
thing, lets just skip ahead to reports type promises as they are the last
promise type to be evaluated according to [normal ordering][normal_ordering].

Reports type promises simply print messages. They will show up in logs or on
the console if you are running the agent interactively. I usually use CFEngine
Enterprise so for me reports are usually only useful for debugging, as I can
easily surface promise outcomes in Mission Portal. They can however be useful
for other log analysis tools like [sumo logic][sumo_logic], [splunk][splunk] or
[log stash][log_stash]. Here I am using it purely for debugging purposes to
print out all of the subnet information that is discovered. Note that I am not
using any class restrictions so for each promise that contains `$(subnets)` the
agent will iterate over each subnet and print the fully expanded result.

Now we are at the end of the first pass. The agent will now go back to vars
type promsies and attempt to activate any promises that have not yet been
repaired (fixed), or previously kept (as desired). The first two variables have
been resolved. If you recall, we skipped the rest on the first pass because no
class was yet defined for `subnet_$(subnet_data[$(subnets)][subnet_nickname])`.
On this second pass, we have the class `subnet_32_2` defined and now the
`subnet_nickname` variable will be set to `subnet_32_2.

In fact, we can activate this policy directly to see its output.

**Note:** The following assumes you have CFEngine installed. If your looking
for a good environment to work on your policy I would reccomend the [CFEngine
Enterprise Vagrant Environment][enterprise_vagrant], that's what I use for my
testing and development environment.

From `services/skeletorg/classification/subnet_location` run
`cf-agent -KIf ./main.cf -b classify_subnet_location -D DEBUG`

```console
[root@hub subnet_location]# cf-agent -KIf ./main.cf -b classify_subnet_location -D DEBUG
2014-08-14T19:32:32+0000     info: Using command line specified bundlesequence

R: classify_subnet_location: Found subnet continent: North America
R: classify_subnet_location: Found subnet country: USA
R: classify_subnet_location: Found subnet site: over_rainbow
```

The command runs the agent without locks (-K), in inform mode (-I), using a
speific file as the entry (-f), sets the bundlesequence to
`classify_subnet_location` (-b), and additionally defines the class `DEBUG` for
the current run (-D). You can find documentation about the
[options cf-agent takes here][cf-agent-docs].

Note how each subnet was found, regardless of weather or not it applied to the
executing host. That is because we have no class restrictions on our reports
type promises to restrict them to only print when the host is within the subnet
range. The variables for subnet_nickname, city, state, continent, country, and
site were only set if an ip on the host fell within the subnet. As you can see,
this host fell within the `192.168.33.2/32` subnet and had its variables set
appropriately. We can verify this by looking at the output of `ip addr show`.

```console
[root@hub subnet_location]# ip addr show | grep "192.168.33.2"
    inet 192.168.33.2/24 brd 192.168.33.255 scope global eth1
```

Sure enough, my host has the ip `192.168.33.2` bound to eth1.

Ok great, now we have a classification policy working. We just need to
integrate it with the rest of our policy. The only thing left to do is to make
sure that our classification policy is being included by our
`services/skeletorg/main.cf` and add the `bundles` list defined in
`bundle common classification_main_file_control` to
the main bundlesequence as defined in `body common control`.

Edit `services/skeletorg/main.cf` and add the following content to the top of the file:

```cf3
bundle common skeletorg_main_file_control
{
  vars:
    "inputs"
      slist => {
                 "$(this.promise_dirname)/classification/main.cf"
               };
}

body file control
{
  inputs => { @(skeletorg_main_file_control.inputs) };
}
```

Notice that we reuse the same pattern from
`services/skeletorg/classification/main.cf` to include other policy files. This
keeps the changes to `promises.cf` minimal. I believe this makes incorperating
changes from the upstream policy framework eaiser, and reduces the mental
burdan when introducing a new person to the policy. I try to keep things
semantically close and only expose as much detail as necessary. To get more
detailed info you simply peel back the appropriate layer much like how bundles
and bodies work in the policy language to limit the details you are confronted
with. Again, I want to re-iterate that there is no right way to organize policy
as long as whatever you are doing makes sense to your orginization and new
people can start digesting your policy without being confronted with every
single detail.

Now edit `promises.cf` and add `@(classification_main_file_control.bundles)` to
`bundlesequnce` in `body common control`. Classification needs to be done early
during the policy run, so I suggest adding it just after the inventory bundles.
Here is a diff of the changes I applied, I am using git, and generated this
using the command `git diff promises.cf`.

```diff

At this point your classification policy is fully integrated with the rest of
the policy. Again we can just run the policy to check it. This time, we will
run the complete policy by running `cf-agent -KIf ./promises.cf -D DEBUG`.

```console

```

Notice that we did not have to specify the `bundlesequence` manually since that
is controlled by `body common control` in `promises.cf`.

Now that we have a classification system lets add some policy to do something useful.

Now that I have shown you how I (currently) like to organize policy I would
like to show you how to report on this info from mission portal.




First I updated the bundlesequence to include `@(skeletorg_main_file_control.common_bundles)`
very early in the [bundlesequence][bundlesequence]. This will be a list of common bundles that
skeletorg will use primarily for classification.
